Project 1

Certainly would have been easier to stick with my original cheesy Magic 8 Ball question game.

I wanted something better and I paid for it.

I don't know how many times I referenced different tutorials, the course material and it's videos.

I didn't track all the places I looked. I originally had the game running with a little jump rope guy.

It was a crop from an animated gif. I didn't end up using it. It worked fine, but I cut it out just in case

it was one of the things impeding functionality. So, no source is referenced.

If I had to cite the site I used most besides the course material, it would have to be
